# Unity-Master-Server-Matchmaking

Please write all changes on changelog.
Ignore the "C Client" folder. It does not do anything important. It was mainly for testing purposes.

#### Usage
To use this, just open it up with an IDE like Visual Studios and click start.
Also don't forget to change the Unity Player path on file Match.cs to what you have locally. (That .exe refers to the built unity player for the unity project)
- Ex: Change it to be "process.StartInfo.FileName = "E:\\Unity Projects\\Hockey - Game\\Build\\Hockey - Game.exe";"
